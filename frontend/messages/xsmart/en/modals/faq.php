                                <p>The teacher\'s commission is 75% of the cost of the lesson for the student. For example, you set the cost of a lesson to $ 20 per hour, which means that you will be paid $ 15 of this amount. Please note that the 1st introductory lesson with each student is not paid to the teacher, this is done in order to protect the system from unauthorized use.</p>
