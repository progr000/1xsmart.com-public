Hi!
I was in the same situation and could not find any solution.
Finally what worked for me is:

Create a folder on your linux server with .crt and .key certificates for example in /opt/mycert

Edit the file /opt/docker-jitsi-meet/docker-compose.yml by adding at the end of the VOLUMES section the following line (WITHOUT quotes):
“- /opt/certificates:/config/keys:Z”

docker-compose down

rm -rf ~/.jitsi-meet-cfg

docker-compose up -d

Hope this can help you

Bye!
